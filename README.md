# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
An analysis of data acquired from Kickstarter to determine funding trends.  This project has an area of focus with a parent category based on "theater" campaigns, with a subcategory based specifically on "plays."

### Purpose
To provide the client with an secondary analysis of campaign funding.  The focus of this secondary analysis is to explore the relationship between campaign success/failure with the primary factors of launch date and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
Analysis included data from the years of 2009 through 2017.  Crowdfunding campaigns included in the analysis totaled 4114 projects.  At client’s request, this data was filtered down to focus on a campaign category of 'theater' projects, for a total of 1393 projects.  This was further filtered to projects listed as 'plays,' for a total of 1066 projects.

Analysis was then broken down for comparison of Successful, Failed, and Canceled projects.  Determination of outcomes based on launch data and based on goals presented below.

No challenges were encountered.  This was thanks to the clients detailed request for how the data was to be analyzed and presented.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The data suggests that campaigns launched during the months of May and June have the highest likelihood of success, regardless of funding goals set.  The months of December and January statistically have the lowest chance of success.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The data suggests that projects with a funding goal less than $5000 that the highest rate of successful funding.  Projects with a funding goal of $10,000 to $15,000 had an approximate chance of 50% to fund successfully.  Projects with a  funding goal over $15,000 trend more towards a failed campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
No challenges or difficulties were encountered.  The client provided clear instructions that allowed for efficient data extrapolation.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Based on launch date, the data supports ‘play’ projects have a launch data of May or June, while avoiding launch dates in December or January.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Based on funding goals, the data supports ‘play’ projects with a funding goal of less than $5000 have the highest chance of successful funding.  Less than 50% of projects with an initial goal of more than $15000 successfully fund (with only a couple outliers).

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The data obtained does not include projects from April 2017 through current.  Trends may have changed based off economic and world health impacts in recent years.  The analysis requested also did not require any rating systems designed around the content of the plays.  User feedback, Campaign Page Presentation/Information, Pledge level data, and Staff Picks may have additional impact on the dataset tested.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Staff Picks – This table could show a link between a “Staff Picked” Campaign versus non-staff picked campaigns for potential funding success.
Length of Campaign – Analysis of the length of the campaign could indicate trends in funding amounts that occurred during specific portions of the campaign versus the overall campaign.
Average Donation – In combination with Pledge Levels offered, this could show a trend towards user interest in these specific types of campaigns.  It could also be used to adjust pledge levels prior to the campaign to enhance the user experience, which in turn could lead to an increase of the average pledge obtained.
